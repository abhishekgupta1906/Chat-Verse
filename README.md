# MERN Chat Verse with Socket.IO

A live chat application for users that was developed with Socket.IO and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js)

Some Features:
- Tech stack: MERN + Socket.io + TailwindCSS + Daisy UI

- Authorization: Routes and endpoints can be protected with middleware that verifies the JWT token to grant access to authenticated users only.
- Developed a real-time messaging feature using Socket.io for a web application, enabling instantaneous communication between users without the need for page refresh.
-  Global state management with Zustand
- üêû Error handling both on the server and on the client
